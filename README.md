# Transcriptomica-Signature-Survival-Analysis
Associating transcriptional signature with survival data

-  subset gene expression data using signature of interest
-  apply signature scoring method of choice - using GSVA single sample GSEA or ssGSEA here  https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/ssGSEAProjection/4#gsc.tab=0  (  you can also use rank based normalization methods )
